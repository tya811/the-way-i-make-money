the way to do it is like a flat rate per play or per shot
so say its 2 dollar shots
if all that person has is a 5 then they can get 3 shots but not get change
and then if people pay in exact change then better
and accept credit cards for everything
and then ask for donations of small coins and change so that eventually i can give peopel change without having to constantly refill 
coin machines and stuff like that. or make the shots 1.75 if the person has exact change. 
and put strange prices on everythign like 63cents or 82 cents per play
and have it make sense to buy small amounts of time on the recording studio. like 1.63 dollars a minute or something and then a few dollars.92 per record attempt


if you start thinking like this, then money gets easier because you don't have to get change and then convert cash to change etcetera constantly. 
people will give you change and small bills and then you can make change eventually.
