i program microchips
so i need tutorials, examples, documents reference sheets, with how to come up with code, and point to the relevant design specs that showed you
which microchip to buy. 

pickit with mplab i guess
and mplab ipe, ide, minidi 8.10
probably voice control so i don't have to type

but yeah i need ludicrous amounts of examples so that itll make it easier for you all to make new things in the future. 
if you need help talk to tutorialspoint and zetcode.
